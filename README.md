## Abstract
The aim of this project is to classify galaxies' images by morphology, given a defined set of classes. To do so, we'll use classical computer vision techniques and compare them to machine learning techniques.

## Environment
1. Create a new virtualPython environment : ``python3 -m venv envgalaxies``
2. Activate it : ``source envgalaxies/bin/activate``
3. Install the packages, with the given `requirements.txt` file : ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
This requirements were built downloading the following packages : 
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- astropy
- keras
- tensorflow
- torch
- opencv-python
- tqdm

## Dataset
The dataset used is available [here](https://www.astromatic.net/projects/efigi/). 
It is called the EFIGI dataset, and is described in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.5734) paper.
