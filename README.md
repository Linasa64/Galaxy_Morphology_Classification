## Abstract
The aim of this project is to classify galaxies' images by morphology, given a defined set of classes. To do so, we'll use classical computer vision techniques and compare them to machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used is available [here](https://www.astromatic.net/projects/efigi/). 
It is called the EFIGI dataset, and is described in [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.5734) paper.
